# Simple-Auth

_EVE Online Auth for PHPBB 3.2.0_

**Not currently working**

The demand for a simple and easy to use auth has been around for awhile so figured I'd deliver something.

This currently will only support Auth for a single corp or an alliance.

This auth requires you to install the extension https://github.com/javiexin/advancedpf (Download link - https://github.com/javiexin/advancedpf/archive/master.zip) as I have no interest in rewriting what that one already does.
