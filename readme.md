# Simple-Auth

_EVE Online Auth for PHPBB 3.2.0_

**Not currently working** (Will change this once I have time to work out the kinks)

**What This Is**
- A super simple auth for a single corp/alliance
- A cron job 

**What This Isn't**
- A complicated multi corp/alliance auth that sets roles based off of members weight
- A phpBB Extension (I'm too lazy to learn how to overcomplicate this)

The demand for a simple and easy to use auth has been around for awhile so figured I'd deliver something.

This auth requires you to install the extension https://github.com/javiexin/advancedpf (Download link - https://github.com/javiexin/advancedpf/archive/master.zip) as I have no interest in rewriting what that one already does.
